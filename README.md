# MegalinePlan---HypothesisTesting

Overview:
Welcome to the Megaline Telecom Data Analysis project! In this project, I analyzed the customer behavior and revenue patterns of Megaline Telecom users. The project is divided into several steps, and each step is explained below in detail.

Instructions:

Step 1: Opened and Studied the Data

Download the necessary datasets using the provided links:
megaline_calls.csv
megaline_internet.csv
megaline_messages.csv
megaline_plans.csv
megaline_users.csv

Step 2: Prepared the Data

Converted the data to the necessary types for analysis.
Found and eliminated errors in the data. Documented the errors you found and described how I removed them.
Calculated, for each user:
The number of calls made and minutes used per month.
The number of text messages sent per month.
The volume of data used per month.
The monthly revenue for each user using the specified formula.

Step 3: Analyzed the Data

Describe customers' behavior by:
Finding the minutes, texts, and data volume users of each plan require per month.
Calculating the mean, variance, and standard deviation for each plan's usage.
Plotting histograms for the usage distributions.
Describing the distributions you observed.

Step 4: Test the Hypotheses

Tested the following hypotheses:
The average revenue from users of the Ultimate and Surf calling plans differs.
The average revenue from users in the NY-NJ area differs from that of users in other regions.
Explain how you formulated the null and alternative hypotheses.
Describe the criterion you used to test the hypotheses and explain why you chose it.
Choose an alpha value for significance.

Step 5: Conclusion

Summarized my findings from the analysis and hypothesis testing.
